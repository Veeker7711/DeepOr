# DeepOr
Small Web Site for DeepOr

REQUIREMENT: lib GD for php5. (packet name for apt is php5-gd)


This website show stats from a .slxs file. It only needs the first column to be a date and it will print it according to the number of iteration of each date.
There is a file selecter which print the available ".xlsx" file in the root directory of the site turning them in button that will activate their own graph ON-CLICK.
There are few features according the time I spend on this project:
-The graph is customisable in "make_graph.php".
-There is the average of operation per day that's following the Graph.

The project is made from PHP5, Javascript and Bootstrap.

Through test, was running on Debian (Jessie), with Apache2.
